0,"This MR image of the brain is diagnostic of a cognitively normal individual. The hippocampus appears intact with no visible atrophy. There is no thinning in the cortical regions, and the brain structures are symmetric with well-preserved sulcal and gyral patterns."
1,"This MR image of the brain is diagnostic of mild cognitive impairment. Mild atrophy is visible in the hippocampus, particularly in the posterior and medial regions. Subtle thinning is noted in the temporal and parietal cortices. There are no significant white matter changes, but early signs of cortical volume reduction are present."
2,"This MR image of the brain is diagnostic of Alzheimer's disease. Significant atrophy is observed in the hippocampus, particularly in the anterior and medial regions. Widespread cortical thinning is seen, especially in the temporal and parietal cortices. Enlarged lateral ventricles and widening of the sulci indicate cerebral atrophy."
